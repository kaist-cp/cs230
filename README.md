### Online sessions

Due to COVID-19, we're going to conduct online sessions for this semester.
The details are TBA.



## Course description

### Context

TBA


### Goal

In this course, you will learn how computers work from a programmerâ€™s perspective. This course
serves as a foundation for courses on computer organization, operating systems, compilers, and
networks.



### Textbook

- Randal E. Bryant and David R. O'Hallaron, [Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective, Third Edition](https://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/), Prentice Hall, 2011
    + Video lectures by the authors available [here](https://scs.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx#folderID=%22b96d90ae-9871-4fae-91e2-b1627b43e25e%22&sortColumn=1&sortAscending=true)
- Brian W. Kernighan and Dennis M. Ritchie, The C Programming Language, Second Edition, Prentice Hall, 1988 (optional)
- [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) (optional)


### Tools

Make sure you're capable of using the following development tools:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/): for downloading the homework skeleton and version-controlling your
  development. If you're not familiar with Git, walk through [this
  tutorial](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials).

    + **IMPORTANT**: you should not expose your work to others. In particular, you should not fork
      the [upstream](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs230) and push there. Please the following
      steps:

        * Directly clone the upstream without forking it.

          ```bash
          $ git clone --origin upstream https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs230.git
          $ cd cs230
          $ git remote -v
          upstream	https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs230.git (fetch)
          upstream	https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs230.git (push)
          ```

        * To get updates from the upstream, fetch and merge `upstream/master`.

          ```bash
          $ git fetch upstream
          $ git merge upstream/master
          ```

    + If you want to manage your development in a Git server, please create your own private
      repository.

        * You may upgrade your GitHub account to "PRO", which is free of charge. Refer to the
          [documentation](https://education.github.com/students)

        * Set up your repository as a remote.

          ```bash
          $ git remote add origin git@github.com:<github-id>/cs230.git
          $ git remote -v
          origin	 git@github.com:<github-id>/cs230.git (fetch)
          origin	 git@github.com:<github-id>/cs230.git (push)
          upstream https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs230.git (fetch)
          upstream https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs230.git (push)
          ```

        * Push to your repository.

          ```bash
          $ git push -u origin master
          ```

- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (optional): for developing your homework. If
  you prefer other editors, you're good to go.
      
- You can connect to server by `ssh s<student-id>@cp-service.kaist.ac.kr -p13000`, e.g., `ssh
  s20071163@cp-service.kaist.ac.kr -p13000`. See [this
  issue](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs230/issues/2) for more detail.

    + Add the following lines in your `~/.ssh/config`:
    
      ```
      Host cs230
        Hostname cp-service.kaist.ac.kr
        Port 14000
        User s<student-id>
      ```
      
      Then you can connect to the server by `ssh cs230`.

    + Now you can [use it as a VSCode remote server as in the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TTVuUIhdn_g&list=PL5aMzERQ_OZ8RWqn-XiZLXm1IJuaQbXp0&index=3).



## Prerequisites

- It is **required** that students already took courses on:

    + Basic understanding of mathematics (MAS101 & MAS102)
    + Basic understanding of programming (CS101)

  Without a proper understanding of these topics, you will highly likely struggle in this course.

- Other recommendations which would help you in this course:

        * [Korean translation](https://missing-semester-kr.github.io/)



## Grading & honor code

### Programming assignments (TBA%)

There will be about 6 or 7 programming assignments. The assignments are the most important part of
this course. All the assignments are single-student assignments.

Assignments will be due at 11:59pm on the specified due date. **After the due date, your submission
will not be accepted.**


### Midterm and final exams (TBA%)

The exams will evaluate your theoretical understanding of shared mutable states.


### Attendance (?%)

You should solve a quiz at the [Course Management](https://gg.kaist.ac.kr/course/7) website for each
session. **You should answer to the quiz by the end of the day.**


### Honor code

[Please sign KAIST School of Computing Honor Code here](https://gg.kaist.ac.kr/quiz/35/).



## Communication

- Course-related announcements and information will be posted on the
  [website](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs230) as well as on the [GitHub issue
  tracker](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs230/issues). You are expected to read all announcements
  within 24 hours of their being posted. It is highly recommended to watch the repository so that
  new announcements will automatically be delivered to you email address.

- Ask your questions via email to [the instructor](https://cp.kaist.ac.kr/jeehoon.kang) or [the head
   TA](https://cp.kaist.ac.kr/kyeongmin.cho) **only if** they are either confidential or
   personal. Otherwise, ask questions in [this repository's issue
   tracker](https://github.com/kaist-cp/cs230/issues). Unless otherwise specified, don't send emails
   to non-head TAs. Any questions failing to do so (e.g. email questions on course materials) will
   not be answered.

    + I'm requiring you to ask questions online first for two reasons. First, clearly writing a
      question is the first step to reach an answer. Second, you can benefit from questions and
      answers of other students.

- We are NOT going to discuss *new* questions during the office hour. Before coming to the office
  hour, please check if there is a similar question on the issue tracker. If there isn't, file a new
  issue and start discussion there. The agenda of the office hour will be the issues that are not
  resolved yet.

- Emails to the instructor or the head TA should begin with "CS230:" in the subject line, followed
  by a brief description of the purpose of your email. The content should at least contain your name
  and student number. Any emails failing to do so (e.g. emails without student number) will not be
  answered.
